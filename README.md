# Code Challenges

Welcome to my Code Challenges repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to saving and organizing all the code challenges I solve, mainly in **C#** and **TypeScript**.

## Structure

- Each challenge source (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) has its own folder:
  - Example: `LeetCode/`, `HackerRank/`
- Inside each source folder, solutions are saved as files named with the challenge number and problem name:
  - Format: `<number>-<problem-name>.<ext>`
  - Example: `LeetCode/0001-two-sum.ts`, `LeetCode/0002-add-two-numbers.cs`

## Languages Used

- **C#**
- **TypeScript**

## Example

```
LeetCode/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 0001-two-sum.ts
  â”œâ”€â”€ 0002-add-two-numbers.cs
HackerRank/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 0010-some-challenge.cs
```

## Why This Repo?

- To track my progress on coding platforms and interviews
- To build a collection of reference solutions
- To share with others and improve my coding skills
